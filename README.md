1. I can ensure that my code is secure and functional through testing to make sure that everything works as it should and to find errors more easily.
2. I encorporate user requirements by first making sure that I understand them clearly then plan out my code with these requirements in mind. I then use testing to make sure that these requirements are met.
3. I approach designing softwarte by trying to fully understand the requirements then making a thought out plan that is still flexible to changing. This makes it so that I can work faster while still being adaptable to challanges.
